# Tehran-House-Price-Kaggle

## Introduction
This project is designed to predict housing prices in Tehran based on real estate transaction data. It utilizes machine learning techniques for analysis and prediction, helping users evaluate and analyze the housing market.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of various models such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest for price prediction.
- **Feature Analysis**: Examination and analysis of key features like area (square meters), number of rooms, geographical location, and construction year.
- **High Accuracy**: The models are trained to provide precise price estimates based on input data.

## Models
- Various machine learning models, including **Linear Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest**, have been used for comparison and selecting the best-performing model.
- The models are trained using data available on Kaggle, with evaluation metrics such as MAE and RMSE to measure prediction accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Adding new data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Optimizing models for faster and more precise execution.

## Contribution
Your contributions are welcome! You can report issues or submit pull requests to improve and refine the project.
